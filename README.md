# Scanneable refill pads (SOS notes compatible)

I coud not find any SOS notes **refill pad** for folders in my town stationer's shops. Even in the biggest malls there was no SOS notes **refill pad** available. They, simply, do not sell them.

Oxford notebooks are great: high quality 90 gr. paper, that is perfect to use with fountain pens. 

But, I do not like bounded pages, I prefer single sheets.
In fact, I think that the most impotant "niche" for this easy-to-scan paper notes are the single sheets, because you backup them with a set of photos.

So I create my own version.

A set of "hand-made" scanneable refill pads (from mobile phone app).
It is based on SOS notes Oxford notebook, so it's compatible with its app for [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hamelin.sosnotes) and [iPhone]().
